# Kaltura-Discord Integration Project Brief

## Project Overview
Create a seamless integration between Kaltura's meeting products (Webinar, Interactive Meeting Room, Virtual Classroom) and Discord, allowing users to launch, join, and interact with Kaltura meetings directly from Discord without additional installations.

## Core Requirements

### User Experience
- Launch Kaltura sessions via Discord bot commands (e.g., slash commands)
- Optional embedding of Kaltura meeting UI directly in Discord voice channels using Activities API
- Automatic authentication based on Discord identity with role mapping
- No additional installations required for end users

### Integration & Scalability
- Utilize standard Discord and Kaltura APIs
- Build stateless, horizontally scalable integration services
- Support thousands of concurrent users

### Security & Compliance
- Protect API keys, session tokens, and user data
- Implement short-lived tokens and secure HTTPS communications
- Centralized secret management
- Maintain audit trails and logging for compliance

### Operational Requirements
- Clear component separation for independent scaling and maintenance
- Robust error handling and monitoring
- Graceful degradation (e.g., fallback to external browser if embedding fails)

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Discord bot with slash commands for meeting management
- API gateway and integration services
- User authentication and mapping service
- Optional Activity embedding for in-Discord experience
- Notification and webhook service for meeting lifecycle events
- Scalable infrastructure and DevOps setup

### Out of Scope
- Custom modifications to Kaltura's core meeting products
- Deep integration with Discord's voice/video infrastructure
- User management outside of the meeting context

## Success Criteria
- Seamless user flow from Discord command to active Kaltura meeting
- Proper role mapping between Discord and Kaltura
- Scalable architecture supporting thousands of concurrent users
- Comprehensive security controls and compliance measures
- Clear documentation and operational procedures
