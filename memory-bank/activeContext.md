# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have successfully implemented the core features for Weeks 1-4 of the project plan:

1. **API Client and Core Services**
   - Created a robust API client with authentication and error handling
   - Updated KalturaService to use the API Gateway with fallback mechanisms
   - Integrated the API client with server-side app.ts

2. **User Presence Framework**
   - Implemented the UserPresence interface for tracking user status
   - Enhanced the Discord SDK wrapper with presence management
   - Created UI components to display user presence information

3. **Synchronization and Network Quality**
   - Added sync metrics tracking for performance analysis
   - Implemented adaptive synchronization based on network conditions
   - Enhanced the UI with network quality indicators

4. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Added comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
   - Implemented performance optimizations for synchronization
   - Added documentation for new components and services

## Recent Changes

### API Client Implementation
- Created a TypeScript-based API client with authentication support
- Implemented request/response interceptors for consistent error handling
- Added retry logic for failed requests
- Integrated with KalturaService for seamless API access

### User Presence Framework
- Defined UserPresence interface with status, network quality, and playback state
- Updated Discord SDK wrapper to track and broadcast user presence
- Implemented UserPresenceDisplay component for visual representation
- Added status indicators for active, inactive, and away states

### Synchronization Enhancements
- Added SyncMetrics tracking for performance analysis
- Implemented adaptive synchronization based on network quality
- Created NetworkIndicator component for visual feedback
- Enhanced synchronization service with metrics-based tolerance adjustment

### UI and Error Handling Improvements
- Improved Discord SDK event subscription handling with better error messages and scope documentation
- Enhanced Kaltura player configuration to prioritize progressive format over HLS to avoid manifest parsing issues
- Disabled airplay feature to resolve Category:7 | Code:7003 errors
- Added custom error handler for manifest parsing errors
- Implemented proxy connection testing to verify connectivity before loading media
- Updated UI to start with logs and viewers hidden by default for a cleaner interface
- Removed unnecessary "Test Kaltura Proxy" button from the UI
- Added additional URL mapping for manifest files to improve media loading

### Deployment and Testing Updates
- Updated setup-and-test.sh to validate user presence components and API Gateway integration
- Enhanced test-before-deploy.sh with comprehensive checks for new features
- Updated deploy-dev.sh and deploy-prod.sh with API Gateway environment variables
- Added new tests to local-api-test.sh for API Gateway and user presence features
- Created documentation for the deployment and testing script updates

## Next Steps
