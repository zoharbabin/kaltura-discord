# Kaltura-Discord Integration Active Context

## Current Focus

We have completed the mid-implementation phase of the Kaltura-Discord integration project and are now focusing on end-to-end testing and preparing for the next development cycle. Our current focus areas are:

1. Conducting comprehensive end-to-end testing of the Discord Bot Integration MVP (Phase 1)
2. Fixing identified issues from testing
3. Finalizing documentation for the MVP usage
4. Preparing for Phase 2: Enhanced Notifications & User Sync

## Current Priorities

1. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Fixed Discord command registration issue (required options must be before optional ones)
   - Created comprehensive end-to-end testing documentation
   - Testing the Discord bot commands with actual Discord server
   - Testing API Gateway endpoints with actual requests
   - Verifying Kaltura API integration with both mock and real responses

2. **Issue Resolution**:
   - Fix JWT_SECRET environment variable configuration
   - Enhance error handling in mock responses
   - Improve handling of undefined values in meeting data
   - Address Discord API validation errors

3. **Documentation Completion**:
   - Completed README with setup and usage instructions
   - Created quick-start guide for essential setup steps
   - Documented architecture overview and system patterns
   - Created testing guides for different scenarios
   - Documented API endpoints and their usage

4. **Preparation for Next Phase**:
   - Finalizing versioning strategy for commands and APIs
   - Planning implementation of notification service
   - Researching webhook handling for Kaltura events
   - Designing user profile synchronization

## Recent Changes

- Fixed Discord command registration issue with required/optional option ordering
- Created comprehensive end-to-end testing documentation
- Created architecture overview and system patterns documentation
- Implemented error handling for listMeetings function
- Created setup and test script for environment setup
- Added detailed troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Created status report with current project state
- Documented next steps for project completion

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Run complete end-to-end test with actual Discord and Kaltura credentials
   - Fix JWT_SECRET in environment configuration
   - Address any issues identified during end-to-end testing
   - Complete API documentation with examples

2. **Upcoming Milestones**:
   - Complete Phase 1 (Discord Bot Integration MVP)
   - Implement versioning for commands and APIs
   - Begin implementation of Phase 2 (Enhanced Notifications & User Sync)
   - Research Discord Activities API for Phase 3 (Embedded Experience)

3. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Enhance error handling with more detailed information
   - Improve mock responses to provide consistent data
   - Add validation to prevent undefined values in critical fields
   - Implement more comprehensive automated tests

## Decisions Made

- Implement default configuration with optional server-specific overrides
- Limit customization to notification types and Discord message templates
- Adopt semantic versioning for Discord bot commands and API integrations
- Use MongoDB for notification storage (recommended)
- Enhance role mapping with configurable approach
- Required options must be placed before optional options in Discord commands

## Open Questions

1. How will we handle rate limits for Discord's API in high-traffic scenarios?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the integration's success and usage?
3. How will we handle backward compatibility for older Discord servers?
4. What level of customization should be allowed for embedded experiences?
5. How should we handle error recovery in production environments?

## Current Blockers

- Need Discord developer account with Activities API access for Phase 3
- Require Kaltura API credentials for production testing
- Awaiting stakeholder feedback on notification system priorities
- JWT_SECRET not properly configured in environment variables
