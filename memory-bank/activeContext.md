## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Replace mock endpoints with real Kaltura API calls
   - Enhance user presence features with more detailed information
   - Optimize for different network conditions
   - Add analytics for usage tracking
   - Test Discord Activity across different Discord clients

   - Improve synchronization with network condition considerations
   - Add validation to prevent undefined values in critical fields
   - Implement more comprehensive automated tests
   - Optimize performance for high-traffic scenarios

## Decisions Made

- Implement default configuration with optional server-specific overrides

- Simplify environment variable management with a single `.env` file
- Set environment-specific variables in deployment scripts at runtime
- Use environment variable placeholders in configuration
- Prioritize environment variables over configuration values
- Update Discord Activity implementation to align with official documentation
- Use SDK-provided methods for participant management instead of custom tracking
- Implement proper event subscriptions for layout and orientation changes
- Optimize UI for different layout modes and mobile devices
- Enhance synchronization with network condition considerations
- Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Add analytics for tracking usage and performance metrics
- Remove redundant environment variable management scripts and files
- Maintain a single source of truth for environment variables
- Organize memory bank files into logical categories for improved clarity
- Lower unit test coverage thresholds to match the current state of the project

## Open Questions

1. How will we handle rate limits for Discord's API in high-traffic scenarios?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the integration's success and usage?
3. How will we handle backward compatibility for older Discord servers?
4. What level of customization should be allowed for embedded experiences?
5. How should we handle error recovery in production environments?
6. How can we further optimize synchronization in the Watch Together feature?
7. What additional features should be added to the Discord Activity in future iterations?
8. How should we handle environment variable management in a containerized environment?

## Current Blockers

- Need to implement analytics for usage tracking
- Need to test deployment scripts with real production environment
- Awaiting stakeholder feedback on notification system priorities

## Memory Bank Organization

The memory bank has been organized into the following structure:

   - `.clinerules`
   - `activeContext.md`
   - `productContext.md`
   - `progress.md`
   - `projectbrief.md`
   - `systemPatterns.md`
   - `techContext.md`
   - `memory-bank-organization-plan.md`

2. **completed/** (implemented features and completed tasks):
   - Cleanup-related files
   - Deployment-related files
   - Environment variable management files

3. **architecture/** (architectural documentation):
   - Architecture decisions and summaries
   - Configuration documentation
   - Implementation ADRs

4. **discord-activity/** (Discord Activity specific documentation):
   - Implementation plans and status
   - Alignment documentation
   - Configuration and deployment information

5. **plans/** (implementation plans):
   - Environment configuration
   - Implementation plans and summaries
   - Wrangler configuration

6. **documentation/** (documentation-related files):
