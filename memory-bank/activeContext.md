# Kaltura-Discord Integration Active Context

## Current Focus

We have completed the late-implementation phase of the Kaltura-Discord integration project and are now focusing on finalizing the Discord Activity implementation, improving deployment processes, and preparing for the next development cycle. Our current focus areas are:

1. Completing the Discord Activity implementation for Watch Together feature (Phase 3)
2. Streamlining deployment processes for both development and production
3. Simplifying environment variable management
4. Finalizing end-to-end testing of the Discord Bot Integration MVP (Phase 1)
5. Preparing for Phase 2: Enhanced Notifications & User Sync

## Current Priorities

1. **Discord Activity Implementation**:
   - Complete the client-side implementation with real-time synchronization
   - Replace mock endpoints with real Kaltura API calls
   - Enhance user presence and interaction features
   - Test across different Discord clients and network conditions

2. **Deployment Process Improvements**:
   - Implemented deployment scripts for both development and production
   - Simplified environment variable management with a single `.env` file
   - Added support for environment variable placeholders in configuration
   - Created comprehensive documentation for deployment processes

3. **Environment Variable Management**:
   - Simplified to a single `.env` file for both components
   - Fixed issues with special characters in environment variables
   - Added support for environment-specific variables in deployment scripts
   - Enhanced configuration service to support environment variable placeholders

4. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Completed successful end-to-end test with actual Discord and Kaltura credentials
   - Verified Discord bot commands functionality with actual Discord server
   - Tested API Gateway endpoints with actual requests
   - Verified Kaltura API integration with both mock and real responses

5. **Issue Resolution**:
   - Fixed JWT_SECRET environment variable configuration
   - Enhanced error handling in mock responses
   - Fixed Discord Activity URL configuration to prioritize environment variables
   - Improved handling of undefined values in meeting data
   - Addressed Discord API validation errors

## Recent Changes

- Implemented deployment scripts for both development and production
- Simplified environment variable management with a single `.env` file
- Fixed issues with special characters in environment variables
- Added support for environment variable placeholders in configuration
- Fixed Discord Activity URL configuration to prioritize environment variables
- Enhanced configuration service to support environment variable placeholders
- Successfully set up and tested the Discord Activity implementation
- Configured Discord Activity for server ID 1283874310720716890
- Implemented host-based synchronization for Watch Together feature
- Created client-side components for Discord Activity (player, sync service, UI)
- Created server-side endpoints for Discord Activity (token exchange, session generation)
- Implemented fallback mechanism for servers without Activities API access
- Created setup and test script for environment setup
- Successfully tested video search and Discord Activity launch

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Complete the Discord Activity implementation by replacing mock endpoints with real API calls
   - Enhance user presence features in the Discord Activity
   - Optimize synchronization for various network conditions
   - Add analytics for usage tracking
   - Test deployment scripts with real production environment

2. **Upcoming Milestones**:
   - Complete Phase 3 (Discord Activity for Watch Together)
   - Implement versioning for commands and APIs
   - Begin implementation of Phase 2 (Enhanced Notifications & User Sync)
   - Prepare for production deployment

3. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Enhance error handling with more detailed information
   - Improve mobile compatibility for Discord Activity
   - Add validation to prevent undefined values in critical fields
   - Implement more comprehensive automated tests
   - Optimize performance for high-traffic scenarios

## Decisions Made

- Implement default configuration with optional server-specific overrides
- Limit customization to notification types and Discord message templates
- Adopt semantic versioning for Discord bot commands and API integrations
- Use MongoDB for notification storage (recommended)
- Enhance role mapping with configurable approach
- Required options must be placed before optional options in Discord commands
- Implement Discord Activity for Watch Together feature using embedded-app-sdk
- Use Vite for frontend development of Discord Activity
- Implement host-based synchronization mechanism for video playback
- Provide fallback mechanism for servers without Activities API access
- Simplify environment variable management with a single `.env` file
- Set environment-specific variables in deployment scripts at runtime
- Use environment variable placeholders in configuration
- Prioritize environment variables over configuration values

## Open Questions

1. How will we handle rate limits for Discord's API in high-traffic scenarios?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the integration's success and usage?
3. How will we handle backward compatibility for older Discord servers?
4. What level of customization should be allowed for embedded experiences?
5. How should we handle error recovery in production environments?
6. How can we further optimize synchronization in the Watch Together feature?
7. What additional features should be added to the Discord Activity in future iterations?
8. How should we handle environment variable management in a containerized environment?

## Current Blockers

- Need to optimize Discord Activity for mobile clients
- Need to implement analytics for usage tracking
- Need to test deployment scripts with real production environment
- Awaiting stakeholder feedback on notification system priorities
