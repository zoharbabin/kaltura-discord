# Kaltura-Discord Integration Active Context

## Current Focus

We have completed the late-implementation phase of the Kaltura-Discord integration project and are now focusing on updating the Discord Activity implementation to align with official documentation, improving deployment processes, and preparing for the next development cycle. Our current focus areas are:

1. Updating the Discord Activity implementation to align with official Discord documentation (Phase 3)
2. Streamlining deployment processes for both development and production
3. Finalizing end-to-end testing of the Discord Bot Integration MVP (Phase 1)
4. Preparing for Phase 2: Enhanced Notifications & User Sync

## Current Priorities

1. **Discord Activity Implementation**:
   - Update the implementation to align with official Discord Activity documentation
   - Implement proper SDK initialization and event handling
   - Enhance participant management and synchronization
   - Optimize for different layout modes and mobile devices
   - Replace mock endpoints with real Kaltura API calls
   - Test across different Discord clients and network conditions

2. **Deployment Process Improvements**:
   - Implemented deployment scripts for both development and production
   - Simplified environment variable management with a single `.env` file
   - Added support for environment variable placeholders in configuration
   - Created comprehensive documentation for deployment processes

3. **Environment Variable Management**:
   - Simplified to a single `.env` file for both components
   - Fixed issues with special characters in environment variables
   - Added support for environment-specific variables in deployment scripts
   - Enhanced configuration service to support environment variable placeholders

4. **Project Cleanup**:
   - Completed the cleanup of redundant files and scripts
   - Removed `simplify-env.sh` and `cleanup-project.sh` scripts as they are no longer needed
   - Updated documentation to reflect the changes
   - Streamlined the project structure for better maintainability
   - Organized memory bank files into logical categories for improved clarity

5. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Completed successful end-to-end test with actual Discord and Kaltura credentials
   - Verified Discord bot commands functionality with actual Discord server
   - Tested API Gateway endpoints with actual requests
   - Verified Kaltura API integration with both mock and real responses

6. **Issue Resolution**:
   - Fixed JWT_SECRET environment variable configuration
   - Enhanced error handling in mock responses
   - Fixed Discord Activity URL configuration to prioritize environment variables
   - Improved handling of undefined values in meeting data
   - Addressed Discord API validation errors

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Update Discord Activity implementation to align with official documentation
   - Implement proper SDK initialization and event handling
   - Enhance participant management using SDK methods
   - Optimize UI for different layout modes and mobile devices
   - Replace mock endpoints with real Kaltura API calls
   - Improve synchronization with network condition considerations
   - Add analytics for usage tracking
   - Test deployment scripts with real production environment

2. **Upcoming Milestones**:
   - Complete Phase 3 (Discord Activity for Watch Together)
   - Implement versioning for commands and APIs
   - Begin implementation of Phase 2 (Enhanced Notifications & User Sync)
   - Prepare for production deployment

3. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Enhance error handling with more detailed information
   - Improve mobile compatibility for Discord Activity
   - Add validation to prevent undefined values in critical fields
   - Implement more comprehensive automated tests
   - Optimize performance for high-traffic scenarios

## Decisions Made

- Implement default configuration with optional server-specific overrides
- Limit customization to notification types and Discord message templates
- Adopt semantic versioning for Discord bot commands and API integrations
- Use MongoDB for notification storage (recommended)
- Enhance role mapping with configurable approach
- Required options must be placed before optional options in Discord commands
- Implement Discord Activity for Watch Together feature using embedded-app-sdk
- Use Vite for frontend development of Discord Activity
- Implement host-based synchronization mechanism for video playback
- Provide fallback mechanism for servers without Activities API access
- Simplify environment variable management with a single `.env` file
- Set environment-specific variables in deployment scripts at runtime
- Use environment variable placeholders in configuration
- Prioritize environment variables over configuration values
- Update Discord Activity implementation to align with official documentation
- Use SDK-provided methods for participant management instead of custom tracking
- Implement proper event subscriptions for layout and orientation changes
- Optimize UI for different layout modes and mobile devices
- Enhance synchronization with network condition considerations
- Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Add analytics for tracking usage and performance metrics
- Remove redundant environment variable management scripts and files
- Maintain a single source of truth for environment variables
- Organize memory bank files into logical categories for improved clarity

## Open Questions

1. How will we handle rate limits for Discord's API in high-traffic scenarios?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the integration's success and usage?
3. How will we handle backward compatibility for older Discord servers?
4. What level of customization should be allowed for embedded experiences?
5. How should we handle error recovery in production environments?
6. How can we further optimize synchronization in the Watch Together feature?
7. What additional features should be added to the Discord Activity in future iterations?
8. How should we handle environment variable management in a containerized environment?

## Current Blockers

- Need to optimize Discord Activity for mobile clients
- Need to implement analytics for usage tracking
- Need to test deployment scripts with real production environment
- Awaiting stakeholder feedback on notification system priorities

## Memory Bank Organization

The memory bank has been organized into the following structure:

1. **Root Directory** (core documents):
   - `.clinerules`
   - `activeContext.md`
   - `productContext.md`
   - `progress.md`
   - `projectbrief.md`
   - `systemPatterns.md`
   - `techContext.md`
   - `memory-bank-organization-plan.md`

2. **completed/** (implemented features and completed tasks):
   - Cleanup-related files
   - Deployment-related files
   - Environment variable management files

3. **architecture/** (architectural documentation):
   - Architecture decisions and summaries
   - Configuration documentation
   - Implementation ADRs

4. **discord-activity/** (Discord Activity specific documentation):
   - Implementation plans and status
   - Alignment documentation
   - Configuration and deployment information

5. **plans/** (implementation plans):
   - Environment configuration
   - Implementation plans and summaries
   - Wrangler configuration

6. **documentation/** (documentation-related files):
   - Documentation update summaries

This organization improves clarity and makes it easier to find relevant information.
