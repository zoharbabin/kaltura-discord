# Kaltura-Discord Integration Cleanup Script

This document contains the cleanup script that was used to remove redundant, unused, or no longer relevant files in the Kaltura-Discord integration project.

## Cleanup Script (Executed)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup-project.sh - Script to remove redundant files from the project

echo "Starting cleanup of redundant files..."

# Create a backup of the entire project
echo "Creating backup of the project..."
BACKUP_DIR="../kaltura-discord-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
cp -r . "$BACKUP_DIR"
echo "Backup created at $BACKUP_DIR"

# Remove redundant environment variable management scripts
echo "Removing redundant environment variable management scripts..."
if [ -f "cleanup-env.sh" ]; then
  rm -f cleanup-env.sh
  echo "Removed cleanup-env.sh"
fi

if [ -f "consolidate-env.sh" ]; then
  rm -f consolidate-env.sh
  echo "Removed consolidate-env.sh"
fi

if [ -f "simplify-env.sh" ]; then
  rm -f simplify-env.sh
  echo "Removed simplify-env.sh"
fi

# Remove redundant environment variable files
echo "Removing redundant environment variable files..."
for env_file in .env.example .env.development.sample .env.production.sample .env.development .env.production; do
  if [ -f "$env_file" ]; then
    rm -f "$env_file"
    echo "Removed $env_file"
  fi
done

# Remove redundant environment variable files in Discord Activity
for env_file in discord-activity/.env.example discord-activity/.env.development discord-activity/.env.production; do
  if [ -f "$env_file" ]; then
    rm -f "$env_file"
    echo "Removed $env_file"
  fi
done

# Optional: Clean generated files
read -p "Do you want to clean generated files (coverage/ and dist/ directories)? (y/n): " clean_generated
if [ "$clean_generated" = "y" ] || [ "$clean_generated" = "Y" ]; then
  echo "Cleaning generated files..."
  
  if [ -d "coverage" ]; then
    rm -rf coverage
    echo "Removed coverage/ directory"
  fi
  
  if [ -d "dist" ]; then
    rm -rf dist
    echo "Removed dist/ directory"
  fi
  
  echo "Note: You will need to rebuild the project to regenerate these files."
fi

echo "Cleanup completed successfully!"
echo "Please verify that the project still builds and functions correctly."
```

## Execution Summary

The cleanup script was executed successfully, and the following actions were taken:

1. Created a backup of the entire project before making any changes
2. Removed redundant environment variable management scripts:
   - `cleanup-env.sh`
   - `consolidate-env.sh`
   - `simplify-env.sh`
3. Removed redundant environment variable files
4. Verified that the project still builds and functions correctly

After the cleanup was completed, the `cleanup-project.sh` script itself was also removed as it was no longer needed.

## Verification Results

After running the cleanup script, the following verification steps were performed:

1. The project was built successfully
2. The deployment scripts worked correctly
3. The environment variables were correctly loaded in both the main project and the Discord Activity component
4. All tests passed successfully

## Conclusion

The cleanup process was completed successfully, resulting in a cleaner project structure with redundant files removed. The project now follows a simplified approach to environment variable management with a single `.env` file.

The project is now ready for the next phase of development, focusing on updating the Discord Activity implementation to align with official documentation, improving deployment processes, and preparing for the next development cycle.
