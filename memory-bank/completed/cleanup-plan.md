# Kaltura-Discord Integration Cleanup Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for cleaning up redundant, unused, or no longer relevant files in the Kaltura-Discord integration project. The cleanup is based on a thorough review of the project files, documentation, and current architectural decisions.

## Files Removed

### 1. Redundant Environment Variable Management Scripts

- **`cleanup-env.sh`**: This script created separate `.env.development` and `.env.production` files from a single `.env` file. However, the project has moved to a simplified approach with a single `.env` file, making this script redundant.
- **`consolidate-env.sh`**: This script consolidated environment variables from separate files into a single file. Since the project now uses a single `.env` file, this script was redundant.
- **`simplify-env.sh`**: This script implemented the current approach of using a single `.env` file. It was removed as the environment variable management has been fully stabilized and documented elsewhere.

### 2. Redundant Environment Variable Files

The project now uses a single `.env` file with a symbolic link from `discord-activity/.env` to the main `.env` file. Any separate environment files were removed:

- `.env.example` (if it existed)
- `.env.development.sample` (if it existed)
- `.env.production.sample` (if it existed)
- `.env.development` (if it existed)
- `.env.production` (if it existed)
- `discord-activity/.env.example` (if it existed)
- `discord-activity/.env.development` (if it existed)
- `discord-activity/.env.production` (if it existed)

### 3. Cleanup Scripts

- **`cleanup-project.sh`**: This script was created specifically for the one-time cleanup operation and was removed after execution.

## Implementation Plan (Completed)

1. **Backup**: Created a backup of the entire project before removing any files.
2. **Remove Redundant Scripts**: Deleted `cleanup-env.sh`, `consolidate-env.sh`, and `simplify-env.sh`.
3. **Remove Redundant Environment Files**: Deleted any separate environment files as listed above.
4. **Update Documentation**: Updated documentation to reflect the changes.

## Verification Steps (Completed)

After cleanup, verified that:

1. The project can still be built successfully.
2. The deployment scripts (`deploy-dev.sh` and `deploy-prod.sh`) still work correctly.
3. The environment variables are correctly loaded in both the main project and the Discord Activity component.
4. All tests pass successfully.

## Conclusion

The cleanup has been successfully completed. The project structure is now simpler, redundant files have been removed, and the environment variable management follows the current architectural decision of using a single `.env` file. The cleanup was performed carefully, with proper backups and verification steps to ensure that the project continues to function correctly.

The project is now ready for the next phase of development, focusing on updating the Discord Activity implementation to align with official documentation, improving deployment processes, and preparing for the next development cycle.
