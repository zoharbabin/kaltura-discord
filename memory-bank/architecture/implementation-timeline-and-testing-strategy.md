   - **Contingency**: Maintain mock data capability for critical failures

2. **Network Conditions**:
   - **Risk**: Poor network conditions may affect synchronization
   - **Mitigation**: Implement adaptive synchronization
   - **Contingency**: Provide manual sync controls and clear feedback

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - **Risk**: Different browsers may have inconsistent behavior
   - **Mitigation**: Test across major browsers
   - **Contingency**: Implement browser-specific workarounds

4. **Mobile Experience**:
   - **Risk**: Mobile devices may have performance or UI issues
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize for mobile with responsive design
   - **Contingency**: Provide simplified UI for low-end devices

5. **User Adoption**:
   - **Risk**: Users may find new presence features confusing
   - **Mitigation**: Provide clear UI and tooltips
   - **Contingency**: Offer simplified mode with basic features

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline and testing strategy provides a structured approach to delivering the API integration and enhanced user presence features. By following this plan, we can ensure a high-quality implementation that meets user needs and provides a robust, reliable experience for watching Kaltura videos together in Discord voice channels.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, reducing risk and allowing for adjustments based on feedback. The comprehensive testing strategy ensures that all aspects of the implementation are thoroughly validated before release.
