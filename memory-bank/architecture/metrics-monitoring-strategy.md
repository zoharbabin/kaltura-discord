## 4. Monitoring Implementation

### 4.1 Logging Strategy

#### 4.1.1 Log Levels
- **ERROR**: Unexpected errors that require immediate attention
- **WARN**: Issues that don't cause system failure but require monitoring
- **INFO**: Important system events and state changes
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging purposes (development only)

#### 4.1.2 Log Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-07T14:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "discord-bot",
  "message": "Command executed successfully",
  "context": {
    "command": "kaltura-start",
