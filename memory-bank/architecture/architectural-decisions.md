# Kaltura-Discord Integration Architectural Decisions

This document summarizes the key architectural decisions for the Kaltura-Discord integration project, which can be used to update the .clinerules file.

## Recent Architectural Decisions

1. **Server-Specific Customization**
   - Decision: Implement a default configuration with optional server-specific overrides
   - Rationale: Allows for customization while maintaining a consistent base experience
   - Implementation: JSON-based configuration files with a configuration service
   - Date: Current architecture update

2. **Configuration Service**
   - Decision: Create a dedicated configuration service for managing server-specific settings
   - Rationale: Centralizes configuration management and provides caching capabilities
   - Implementation: File-based storage with in-memory caching
   - Date: Current architecture update

3. **Semantic Versioning**
   - Decision: Adopt semantic versioning for Discord bot commands and API integrations
   - Rationale: Provides clear compatibility guidelines and upgrade paths
   - Implementation: Version metadata in commands and URL-based API versioning
   - Date: Current architecture update

4. **MongoDB for Notification Storage**
   - Decision: Use MongoDB for storing notification preferences and delivery status
   - Rationale: Flexible schema, scalability, and query capabilities
   - Implementation: Dedicated collections for preferences and delivery status
   - Date: Current architecture update

5. **Enhanced Role Mapping**
   - Decision: Implement configurable role mapping between Discord and Kaltura
   - Rationale: Provides flexibility for different server structures and permission models
   - Implementation: Configuration-based mapping with default fallbacks
   - Date: Current architecture update

6. **Notification Templates**
   - Decision: Implement customizable message templates for Discord notifications
   - Rationale: Allows servers to customize notification appearance and content
   - Implementation: Template strings with variable substitution
   - Date: Current architecture update

7. **Metrics and Monitoring Strategy**
   - Decision: Implement comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring
   - Rationale: Enables performance tracking, issue detection, and business insights
   - Implementation: Prometheus for metrics, ELK Stack for logging, Grafana for visualization
   - Date: Current architecture update

8. **Testing Strategy**
   - Decision: Implement multi-level testing approach (unit, integration, end-to-end)
   - Rationale: Ensures quality and reliability across all components
   - Implementation: Jest for unit tests, custom harnesses for integration and E2E tests
   - Date: Current architecture update

## Implementation Principles

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Default configuration with override capability
   - Hierarchical configuration structure
   - Configuration caching with TTL
   - Dynamic configuration reloading

2. **Versioning Strategy**
   - Semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
   - URL-based API versioning
   - Version compatibility layers
   - Deprecation notices and sunset policies

3. **Notification System**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Template-based message formatting
   - Server-specific delivery preferences
   - Delivery status tracking and retries

4. **Role Mapping**
   - Configuration-based role mapping
   - Default role assignments
   - Hierarchical privilege model
   - Server-specific customization

5. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit testing for individual components
   - Integration testing for service interactions
   - End-to-end testing for complete flows
   - Performance testing for scalability validation

6. **Metrics Collection**
   - User engagement metrics
   - Performance metrics
   - Error metrics
   - Business metrics

## Architecture Patterns

1. **Configuration Management Pattern**
   - Default configuration with override capability

   - Configuration caching with TTL
   - Dynamic configuration reloading

2. **Versioning Pattern**
   - Semantic versioning
   - API versioning
   - Command versioning
   - Compatibility layers

3. **Notification Pattern**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Template-based message formatting
   - Server-specific delivery preferences
   - Delivery status tracking

4. **Role Mapping Pattern**
   - Configuration-based mapping
   - Default role assignments
   - Hierarchical privilege model
   - Server-specific customization

## Technology Decisions

1. **Configuration Storage**
