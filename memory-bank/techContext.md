## Deployment Environment

### Development Environment

- Node.js 18+ runtime
- Local development server with Cloudflare tunnel
- HTTPS termination through Cloudflare
- Single `.env` file with environment-specific variables set at runtime
- Discord Activity URL: https://discord-dev.zoharbabin.com
- Automatic reload on code changes

### Production Environment

- Node.js 18+ runtime
- Cloudflare Workers for serverless deployment
- HTTPS termination through Cloudflare
- Single `.env` file with environment-specific variables set at runtime
- Discord Activity URL: https://discord.zoharbabin.com
- Optimized builds for production

### Deployment Scripts

- **deploy-dev.sh**: For local development with Cloudflare tunnel
- **deploy-prod.sh**: For production deployment to Cloudflare
- **simplify-env.sh**: For simplifying environment variable management
- **cleanup-env.sh**: For cleaning up environment files
- **test-before-deploy.sh**: For running tests before deployment

### Environment Management

- Single `.env` file for both components
- Environment-specific variables set by deployment scripts at runtime
- Safe handling of special characters in environment variables
- Symbolic link for shared environment file between components
- Environment variable placeholders in configuration ({{ENV_VAR_NAME}})

### Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scaling through Cloudflare Workers
- Cloudflare for global content delivery
- Configuration caching with TTL
- Rate limiting for Discord Bot commands
- Host-based synchronization for Discord Activity

## Technical Constraints

### Discord Limitations

- Rate limits on API requests (50-100 requests per second depending on endpoint)
- Maximum embed size and formatting restrictions
- Activities API limitations and compatibility
- Webhook payload size restrictions
- Discord Activity mobile compatibility challenges

### Kaltura Limitations

- API rate limits and quotas
- Session token expiration and renewal requirements
- Embedding restrictions and domain whitelisting
- User provisioning limitations
- Webhook delivery guarantees and retry mechanisms

### Cloudflare Limitations

- Workers CPU and memory limits
- Workers execution time limits
- Tunnel connection stability
- DNS propagation delays

## Security Requirements

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- JWT for service-to-service authentication
- HTTPS for all external communications
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs

- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure storage of server-specific configurations
- Safe handling of special characters in environment variables

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR compliance for user data handling
- Data retention policies for logs and user information
- Accessibility standards for user interfaces
- Terms of service alignment between Discord and Kaltura
- Server-specific data isolation

## Performance Targets

- API Gateway response time < 200ms (95th percentile)

### Command Versioning

- Version metadata in command definitions
- Command compatibility layer
- Graceful handling of deprecated commands
- Version documentation in help commands

## Configuration Management

### Configuration Structure
