## Deployment Environment

### Production Requirements

- Node.js 18+ runtime
- Kubernetes cluster (or equivalent orchestration)
- HTTPS termination and TLS certificates
- Network security groups and firewall rules
- Scalable compute resources (min 2 replicas per service)
- MongoDB database for configuration and notification storage
- Redis cluster for distributed caching

### Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU/memory metrics
- Redis cluster for distributed caching
- Load balancing for API Gateway
- Rate limiting for Discord Bot commands
- Configuration caching with TTL

## Technical Constraints

### Discord Limitations

- Rate limits on API requests (50-100 requests per second depending on endpoint)
- Maximum embed size and formatting restrictions
- Activities API limitations and compatibility
- Webhook payload size restrictions

### Kaltura Limitations

- API rate limits and quotas
- Session token expiration and renewal requirements
- Embedding restrictions and domain whitelisting
- User provisioning limitations
- Webhook delivery guarantees and retry mechanisms

## Security Requirements

- All API keys and secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault
- JWT or equivalent for service-to-service authentication
- HTTPS for all external communications
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Regular security scanning and dependency updates
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure storage of server-specific configurations

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR compliance for user data handling
- Data retention policies for logs and user information
- Accessibility standards for user interfaces
- Terms of service alignment between Discord and Kaltura
- Server-specific data isolation

## Performance Targets

- API Gateway response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Meeting creation time < 2 seconds
- Notification delivery < 500ms from event
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users per instance
- 99.9% uptime SLA target
- Configuration service response time < 50ms (95th percentile)

## Version Management

### API Versioning

- URL-based versioning (/api/v1/resource)
- Semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
- Version compatibility layer for backward compatibility
- Deprecation notices and sunset policies

### Command Versioning

- Version metadata in command definitions
- Command compatibility layer
- Graceful handling of deprecated commands
- Version documentation in help commands

## Configuration Management

### Configuration Structure

- Default configuration in JSON format
- Server-specific overrides in separate files
- Configuration schema validation
- Hot reloading of configuration changes
- Configuration caching with TTL

### Configuration Security

- Access control for configuration changes
- Validation of configuration values
- Secure storage of sensitive configuration
- Audit logging for configuration changes
