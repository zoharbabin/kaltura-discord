# Discord Activity Implementation Status

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the Discord Activity implementation for the Kaltura Watch Together feature. It includes the current status, completed components, pending tasks, and recommendations for future development.

## Current Status

The Discord Activity implementation is currently in the late stages of development, with approximately 80% of the planned functionality completed. The core components have been implemented and tested successfully, with significant improvements to error handling, UI, and media playback reliability. Recent updates have focused on resolving WARN and ERROR messages in the logs, improving the user interface, and enhancing the Kaltura player configuration for better reliability in proxied environments. The remaining work is focused on replacing mock endpoints with real API calls, further enhancing user presence features, optimizing for mobile clients, and adding analytics for usage tracking.

## Completed Components

### Client-Side Implementation

1. **Project Structure**
   - Set up client package with Vite and TypeScript
   - Organized code into logical components and services

2. **Discord SDK Integration**
   - Implemented authentication flow with OAuth2
   - Set up message passing for synchronization
   - Integrated with Discord's voice channel information
   - Improved Discord SDK event subscription handling with better error messages
   - Added proper scope documentation for Discord SDK events
   - Enhanced error handling for Discord SDK authentication and event subscriptions

3. **Kaltura Player Integration**
   - Created custom wrapper around Kaltura Player SDK
   - Implemented playback controls (play, pause, seek)
   - Added event handling for player state changes
   - Enhanced Kaltura player configuration to prioritize progressive format over HLS
   - Disabled airplay feature to resolve Category:7 | Code:7003 errors
   - Added custom error handler for manifest parsing errors
   - Implemented proxy connection testing to verify connectivity before loading media

4. **Synchronization Mechanism**
   - Implemented host-based synchronization
   - Created message passing system for playback events
   - Added configurable tolerance for synchronization

5. **User Interface**
   - Designed Discord-themed UI with playback controls
   - Implemented loading and error states
   - Added basic user presence display
   - Updated UI to start with logs and viewers hidden by default for a cleaner interface
   - Removed unnecessary "Test Kaltura Proxy" button from the UI

### Server-Side Implementation

1. **Project Structure**
   - Set up server package with Express.js and TypeScript
   - Organized code into controllers, services, and utilities

2. **Authentication Endpoints**
   - Implemented token exchange endpoint for Discord OAuth2
   - Added error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Mock API Endpoints**
   - Created mock endpoints for Kaltura session generation
   - Implemented mock video details endpoint
   - Added health check endpoint

### Integration with Main Application

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Added Discord Activities API configuration to the existing configuration service
   - Implemented server-specific configuration for Activities API access

2. **Button Interactions**
   - Added "Watch Together (Discord Activity)" button for servers with Activities API access
   - Implemented fallback to custom implementation for servers without Activities API access

3. **Setup and Testing**
   - Created setup script for Discord Activity
   - Implemented configuration for server ID 1283874310720716890
   - Successfully tested video search and Discord Activity launch

## Pending Tasks

1. **API Integration**
   - Replace mock endpoints with real Kaltura API calls
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Improve user presence display with avatars and status indicators
   - Add chat integration with Discord's voice chat
   - Enhance loading and error states with more detailed information

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Optimize UI for mobile Discord clients
   - Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
   - Ensure touch controls work properly

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize synchronization for various network conditions
   - Implement adaptive quality selection based on network conditions
   - Reduce resource usage for better performance on low-end devices

5. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - Define metrics for usage tracking
   - Implement analytics for user engagement
   - Add monitoring for error rates and performance issues

## Technical Debt

1. **Mock Endpoints**
   - The server currently uses mock data for Kaltura session generation and video details
   - These need to be replaced with real API calls before production deployment

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error handling for Discord SDK event subscriptions with better scope documentation
   - Enhanced Kaltura player error handling for manifest parsing issues
   - Added custom error handler for manifest parsing errors
   - Still need to implement more comprehensive recovery mechanisms for various failure scenarios

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Limited testing has been done on mobile clients
   - Need more comprehensive testing across different devices and network conditions

4. **Documentation**
   - API documentation needs to be completed with examples
   - User documentation for the Watch Together feature needs to be created

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Short-Term Priorities**
   - Replace mock endpoints with real Kaltura API calls
   - Enhance user presence features
   - Test and optimize for mobile clients

2. **Medium-Term Priorities**
   - Add analytics for usage tracking
   - Optimize synchronization for various network conditions
   - Implement more comprehensive error handling and recovery

3. **Long-Term Priorities**
   - Add more advanced features like chat integration
   - Implement adaptive quality selection
   - Create comprehensive user documentation

## Conclusion

The Discord Activity implementation for the Kaltura Watch Together feature has made significant progress, with the core functionality working as expected. The remaining work is focused on replacing mock endpoints with real API calls, enhancing user presence features, optimizing for mobile clients, and adding analytics for usage tracking.

The implementation follows the architectural decisions outlined in the ADR and implementation plan, with a focus on providing a seamless, synchronized video watching experience directly within Discord voice channels. The fallback mechanism ensures that servers without Activities API access can still use the Watch Together feature, albeit with a less integrated experience.

With the completion of the pending tasks, the Discord Activity implementation will provide a robust, user-friendly experience for watching Kaltura videos together within Discord voice channels.
