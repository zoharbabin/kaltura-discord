   - Add analytics for usage tracking
   - Follow the prioritized roadmap in discord-activity-next-steps.md

2. **Begin Phase 2 Implementation**
   - Start implementing the notification service
   - Develop webhook handling for Kaltura events
   - Create user profile synchronization

3. **Prepare for Production Deployment**
   - Implement versioning for commands and APIs
   - Begin containerization of services
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

4. **Address Technical Debt**
   - Improve test coverage
   - Refactor code for better maintainability
   - Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Conclusion

The workspace has been prepared for the next series of programming updates by updating the memory bank and documentation to reflect the current state of the project. The Discord Activity implementation has made significant progress, with the core functionality working as expected. The remaining work is focused on replacing mock endpoints with real API calls, enhancing user presence features, optimizing for mobile clients, and adding analytics for usage tracking.

By following the recommendations and prioritized roadmap provided in the documentation, the development team can efficiently complete the implementation and prepare for production deployment.
