# Kaltura-Discord Integration Product Context

## Project Purpose

The Kaltura-Discord integration aims to bridge the gap between Discord's community-focused platform and Kaltura's professional virtual meeting solutions. This integration enables educational institutions, businesses, and communities to leverage both platforms' strengths:

- **Discord**: Community building, persistent chat, voice channels, and social engagement
- **Kaltura**: Enterprise-grade virtual classrooms, webinars, and interactive meeting rooms

By integrating these platforms, we create a seamless experience that eliminates friction between community engagement and structured virtual events.

## User Goals

### For Discord Server Administrators
- Easily schedule and manage Kaltura meetings/classes directly from Discord
- Control access to meeting creation based on Discord roles
- Receive notifications about meeting lifecycle events in designated channels
- Maintain a consistent user experience within their community

### For Discord Users/Meeting Participants
- Join Kaltura meetings with minimal friction (ideally without leaving Discord)
- Maintain their identity and role consistency between platforms
- Access meeting recordings and resources through Discord
- Seamlessly transition between casual Discord conversations and structured Kaltura sessions

### For Educators/Presenters
- Launch virtual classrooms or webinars directly to their Discord audience
- Leverage Kaltura's advanced teaching tools while maintaining Discord community engagement
- Control participant roles and permissions based on Discord roles
- Share recordings and follow-up materials with their Discord community

## Problems Solved

1. **Platform Switching Friction**: Users no longer need to leave Discord and authenticate separately on Kaltura

3. **In-Platform Experience**: Optional embedding provides an integrated experience without leaving Discord
