# Kaltura-Discord Integration System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
The integration is designed as a collection of loosely coupled microservices, each with a specific responsibility:

1. **Discord Bot Service**: Handles Discord interactions and commands
2. **API Gateway**: Routes requests and manages authentication
3. **Kaltura Integration Service**: Interfaces with Kaltura APIs
4. **User Authentication Service**: Manages identity mapping and token generation
5. **Notification Service**: Handles webhooks and event notifications
6. **Configuration Service**: Manages server-specific configurations

This approach allows for:
- Independent scaling of components based on load
- Isolated failure domains
- Technology flexibility for each service
- Independent deployment and versioning

### API Gateway Pattern
The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client-side requests, providing:
- Request routing
- API composition
- Protocol translation
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Version management

### Event-Driven Architecture
For notifications and asynchronous processes:
- Services communicate through events when appropriate
- Webhook events from Kaltura trigger Discord notifications
- Meeting lifecycle events are published to interested subscribers

### Configuration Management Pattern
For server-specific customization:
- Default configuration with override capability
- Hierarchical configuration structure
- Configuration caching with TTL
- Dynamic configuration reloading

```

## Data Flow Patterns

### Command Flow
1. User issues command in Discord
2. Discord Bot validates permissions
3. Request routed through API Gateway
4. Kaltura Integration Service creates session
5. User Auth Service generates tokens
6. Response returns to Discord Bot
7. Bot presents join options to user

### Notification Flow
1. Kaltura meeting event occurs
2. Webhook received by Notification Service
3. Configuration Service provides server preferences
4. Event processed and formatted using templates
5. Discord message sent to configured channel
6. Audit log entry created

### Configuration Flow
1. Default configuration loaded at startup
2. Server-specific overrides applied when available
3. Configuration cached with TTL
4. Services request configuration from Configuration Service
5. Configuration reloaded when TTL expires

## Security Patterns

### Token-Based Authentication
- Short-lived Kaltura Session (KS) tokens generated per user
- Tokens include user identity and role information
- No persistent storage of credentials

### Least Privilege Principle
- Discord Bot requests only necessary permissions
- API Gateway enforces role-based access control
- Kaltura sessions created with minimum required privileges

### Secure Communication
- All service-to-service communication over HTTPS
- API keys and tokens transmitted securely
- Sensitive data never logged or exposed

## Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevents cascading failures when external services are unavailable
- Automatically retries with exponential backoff
- Provides fallback mechanisms when primary paths fail

### Graceful Degradation
- Link-based fallback when embedding is unavailable
- Reduced functionality mode when certain services are impaired
- Clear user messaging about service status

### Monitoring and Health Checks
- Each service exposes health endpoints
- Centralized monitoring of service status
- Automated alerting for service degradation

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless services allow for easy replication
- Load balancing across service instances
- Auto-scaling based on demand metrics

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently used Discord server configurations
- Cache Kaltura session metadata (not tokens)
- Distributed cache for high availability

## Versioning Patterns

### Semantic Versioning
- Major.Minor.Patch version format
- Major version for breaking changes
- Minor version for backward-compatible features
- Patch version for backward-compatible fixes

### API Versioning
- URL-based versioning (/api/v1/resource)
- Version compatibility layer
- Deprecation notices and sunset policies

### Command Versioning
- Version metadata in command definitions
- Command compatibility layer
- Graceful handling of deprecated commands

## Development Patterns

### API-First Design
- Define service interfaces before implementation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- Contract-based testing between services

### Infrastructure as Code
- All infrastructure defined in code (e.g., Terraform)
- Containerized services with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling

### Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Automated testing for all components
- Deployment pipelines with staging environments
- Feature flags for controlled rollout
