## Architectural Decisions

1. **Server-Specific Customization**:
   - Implement a default configuration with optional server-specific overrides
   - Store configuration in JSON files in the config directory
   - Limit customization to notification types and Discord message templates

2. **Versioning and Compatibility**:
   - Adopt semantic versioning for Discord bot commands and API integrations
   - Implement URL-based versioning for the API Gateway
   - Add version metadata to command definitions

3. **Notification System**:
   - Create a dedicated notification service
   - Use MongoDB for notification storage (recommended)
   - Implement webhook handling for Kaltura events

4. **Role Mapping**:
   - Enhance the user authentication service with configurable role mapping
   - Store role mappings in server-specific configuration
   - Allow server administrators to define custom role mappings

5. **Discord Command Structure**:
   - Required options must be placed before optional options
   - Use consistent naming conventions for commands and options
   - Implement permission checks for administrative commands

6. **Discord Activity Implementation**:
   - Use Discord's embedded-app-sdk for Watch Together feature
   - Update implementation to align with official Discord Activity documentation
   - Use SDK-provided methods for participant management
   - Implement proper event subscriptions for layout and orientation changes
   - Optimize UI for different layout modes and mobile devices
   - Implement host-based synchronization for video playback
   - Enhance synchronization with network condition considerations
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Provide fallback mechanism for servers without Activities API access
   - Use Vite for frontend development of Discord Activity
   - Implement client-server architecture with Express.js backend

7. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Use Cloudflare for hosting the Discord Activity
   - Implement separate deployment scripts for development and production
   - Use a single `.env` file with environment-specific variables set at runtime
   - Implement pre-deployment testing to ensure code quality

8. **Environment Variable Management**:
   - Use a single `.env` file for both components
   - Set environment-specific variables in deployment scripts at runtime
   - Use environment variable placeholders in configuration
   - Prioritize environment variables over configuration values

9. **Project Cleanup Strategy**:
   - Identify and remove redundant environment variable management scripts
   - Remove redundant environment variable files
   - Optionally clean generated files that can be regenerated
   - Maintain a single source of truth for environment variables
   - Document the cleanup process for future reference
