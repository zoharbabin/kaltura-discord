## Implementation Details

### API Client and Core Services
The API Client service provides a unified interface for making API requests to the backend. It handles authentication, request formatting, and error handling. The KalturaService has been updated to use this API client when available, with fallback to direct API calls for development and testing.

Key features:
- Token-based authentication
- Automatic retry for failed requests
- Consistent error handling
- Development mode fallbacks

### User Presence Framework
The User Presence framework tracks user status, activity, and network conditions. It integrates with the Discord SDK to provide real-time updates on user presence.

Key components:
- UserPresence interface defining user status and metadata
- Discord SDK wrapper with presence management
- UserPresenceDisplay component for UI representation

### Synchronization and Network Quality
The enhanced synchronization system adapts to network conditions to provide a smoother experience. It tracks metrics on synchronization quality and adjusts tolerance based on network conditions.

Key features:
- SyncMetrics tracking for performance analysis
- Adaptive synchronization based on network quality
- NetworkIndicator component for visual feedback

### Testing and Optimization
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling, fallbacks for development and testing, and performance optimizations.

Key improvements:
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Development mode with mock data
- Optimized synchronization algorithm

## Recent Updates

### UI and Error Handling Improvements
- Improved Discord SDK event subscription handling with better error messages and scope documentation
- Enhanced Kaltura player configuration to prioritize progressive format over HLS to avoid manifest parsing issues
- Disabled airplay feature to resolve Category:7 | Code:7003 errors
- Added custom error handler for manifest parsing errors
- Implemented proxy connection testing to verify connectivity before loading media
- Updated UI to start with logs and viewers hidden by default for a cleaner interface
- Removed unnecessary "Test Kaltura Proxy" button from the UI
- Added additional URL mapping for manifest files to improve media loading

### Deployment and Testing Script Updates
- Updated setup-and-test.sh to validate user presence components and API Gateway integration
- Enhanced test-before-deploy.sh with comprehensive checks for new features
- Updated deploy-dev.sh and deploy-prod.sh with API Gateway environment variables
- Added new tests to local-api-test.sh for API Gateway and user presence features
- Created documentation for the deployment and testing script updates
