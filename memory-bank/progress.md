## Known Issues

| ID | Issue | Priority | Status | Notes |
|----|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Discord command registration error | High | Fixed | Required options must be placed before optional options |
| 2 | JWT_SECRET not properly configured | Medium | Open | Using default development secret |

| 4 | Undefined meeting IDs in mock responses | Low | Open | Can cause issues in subsequent operations |

## Recent Completions

- Fixed Discord command registration issue with required/optional option ordering
- Created comprehensive end-to-end testing documentation
- Created architecture overview and system patterns documentation
- Implemented error handling for listMeetings function
- Created setup and test script for environment setup
- Added detailed troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Created status report with current project state
- Documented next steps for project completion
- Created quick-start guide for essential setup steps
- Completed README with setup and usage instructions

## Next Actions

1. Run complete end-to-end test with actual Discord and Kaltura credentials
2. Fix JWT_SECRET in environment configuration
3. Address any issues identified during end-to-end testing
4. Complete API documentation with examples
5. Add versioning metadata to commands and APIs
6. Begin implementation of notification service

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Need Discord developer account with Activities API access | Blocks embedded experience development | Proceed with link-based approach first |
| Require Kaltura API credentials | Blocks integration development | Use mock responses initially |
| Awaiting stakeholder feedback on priorities | May affect development sequence | Focus on core bot functionality first |
| JWT_SECRET not properly configured | Security risk in production | Update .env file with secure secret |

## Architectural Decisions

1. **Server-Specific Customization**:
   - Implement a default configuration with optional server-specific overrides
   - Store configuration in JSON files in the config directory
   - Limit customization to notification types and Discord message templates

2. **Versioning and Compatibility**:
   - Adopt semantic versioning for Discord bot commands and API integrations
   - Implement URL-based versioning for the API Gateway
   - Add version metadata to command definitions

3. **Notification System**:
   - Create a dedicated notification service
   - Use MongoDB for notification storage (recommended)
   - Implement webhook handling for Kaltura events

4. **Role Mapping**:
   - Enhance the user authentication service with configurable role mapping
   - Store role mappings in server-specific configuration
   - Allow server administrators to define custom role mappings

5. **Discord Command Structure**:
   - Required options must be placed before optional options
   - Use consistent naming conventions for commands and options
   - Implement permission checks for administrative commands
