# Kaltura-Discord Integration Status Report

## Project Overview

The Kaltura-Discord integration project aims to create a seamless integration between Kaltura's meeting products (Webinar, Interactive Meeting Room, Virtual Classroom) and Discord, allowing users to launch, join, and interact with Kaltura meetings directly from Discord without additional installations.

## Current Status

**Overall Progress: 70%**

The project is currently in the mid-implementation phase. The core components have been implemented, and we are now working on testing the end-to-end flow and completing documentation.

### Completed Components

1. **Discord Bot Service**
   - Basic bot structure with command registration
   - Command handlers for all Discord bot commands
   - Interaction handling for buttons and slash commands

2. **API Gateway**
   - Express.js server with authentication middleware
   - Endpoints for meetings and authentication
   - CORS and error handling

3. **Kaltura Client**
   - Session management
   - Meeting creation, retrieval, and management
   - Join URL generation
   - Mock responses for development without Kaltura API access

4. **User Authentication Service**
   - Discord to Kaltura user mapping
   - JWT-based authentication system
   - Role-based access control

5. **Configuration Service**
   - Default configuration with server-specific overrides
   - Configuration caching with TTL
   - Configuration management commands

### In Progress

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test script created
   - Need to test with actual Discord server and Kaltura API

2. **Documentation**
   - README created with setup and usage instructions
   - Need to complete API documentation

3. **Server-Specific Customization**
   - Configuration commands implemented
   - Need to test with multiple Discord servers

### Not Started

1. **Embedded Experience (Phase 3)**
   - Research on Discord Activities API
   - Implementation of embedded Kaltura experience

2. **Production Scaling & Monitoring (Phase 4)**
   - Containerization
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Monitoring and alerting

## Testing Results

End-to-end testing has been set up with a comprehensive test script that covers:

1. Configuration Service
2. User Authentication Service
3. Kaltura Client
4. API Gateway
5. Discord Bot Commands (mock interactions)

The test script uses mock responses for Kaltura API and Discord interactions to avoid making actual API calls during testing.

## Current Blockers

1. **Discord Developer Account with Activities API Access**
   - Required for Phase 3 (Embedded Experience)
   - Currently blocking embedded experience development
   - Mitigation: Proceed with link-based approach first

2. **Kaltura API Credentials for Production Testing**
   - Required for testing with actual Kaltura API
   - Currently using mock responses
   - Mitigation: Continue development with mock responses until credentials are available

3. **Stakeholder Feedback on Notification System Priorities**
   - Required for finalizing notification system design
   - Currently proceeding with default notification system

## Recommendations

1. **Complete End-to-End Testing**
   - Set up a test Discord server
   - Obtain Kaltura API credentials for testing
   - Run the end-to-end test script with actual APIs

2. **Finalize Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add examples for common use cases
   - Create setup instructions for Discord bot configuration

3. **Implement Versioning**
   - Add version metadata to command definitions
   - Implement URL-based versioning for the API Gateway
   - Create CHANGELOG.md for tracking changes

4. **Prepare for Phase 2: Enhanced Notifications & User Sync**
   - Finalize notification system design
   - Implement webhook handling for Kaltura events
   - Set up MongoDB for notification storage

5. **Research Phase 3: Embedded Experience**
   - Obtain Discord developer account with Activities API access
   - Research Discord Activities API capabilities
   - Design embedded experience

## Conclusion

The Kaltura-Discord integration project is progressing well, with most of the core components implemented. The focus now should be on completing end-to-end testing, finalizing documentation, and preparing for the next phases of development.

The project has a solid architecture with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend and maintain. The use of TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest ensures code quality and testability.

With the completion of the current tasks and the implementation of the recommendations, the project will be ready for production deployment and further enhancements.
