# Kaltura-Discord Integration Testing Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the end-to-end testing process for the Kaltura-Discord integration project. It explains how to test the project, what components are tested, and what the expected results are.

## Testing Environment

The project can be tested in two modes:

1. **Development Mode with Mock Responses**
   - Uses mock responses for Kaltura API calls
   - Does not require actual Kaltura API credentials
   - Discord bot runs without connecting to Discord API
   - Suitable for development and initial testing

2. **Production Mode with Actual APIs**
   - Connects to actual Kaltura API
   - Requires valid Kaltura API credentials
   - Discord bot connects to Discord API
   - Requires Discord bot token and client ID
   - Suitable for final testing and production

## Testing Components

The end-to-end testing covers the following components:

1. **Configuration Service**
   - Loading default configuration
   - Server-specific configuration overrides
   - Configuration caching and TTL

2. **User Authentication Service**
   - Discord to Kaltura user mapping
   - JWT token generation and verification
   - Role-based access control

3. **Kaltura Client**
   - Session management
   - Meeting creation, retrieval, and management
   - Join URL generation

4. **API Gateway**
   - Authentication middleware
   - Meeting endpoints
   - Error handling

5. **Discord Bot**
   - Command registration
   - Command handling
   - Interaction handling

## Testing Process

### Automated Testing

The project includes an end-to-end test script (`tests/end-to-end-test.js`) that tests all components of the integration. This script uses mock responses for Kaltura API and Discord interactions to avoid making actual API calls during testing.

To run the automated tests:

```bash
# Build the project first
npm run build

# Run the end-to-end test
node tests/end-to-end-test.js
```

### Manual Testing

For manual testing, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the environment**
   - Create a `.env` file with your credentials (see `.env.example`)
   - Build the project: `npm run build`
   - Start the application: `npm run dev`

2. **Test Discord Bot Commands**
   - Add the bot to your Discord server
   - Use the following slash commands:
     - `/kaltura-start`: Start a new meeting
     - `/kaltura-join`: Join an existing meeting
     - `/kaltura-list`: List all active meetings
     - `/kaltura-end`: End a meeting
     - `/kaltura-config-view`: View configuration
     - `/kaltura-config-update`: Update configuration
     - `/kaltura-config-reset`: Reset configuration

3. **Test API Endpoints**
   - Use a tool like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints
   - Generate a token: `POST /api/auth/token`
   - List meetings: `GET /api/meetings`
   - Create a meeting: `POST /api/meetings`
   - Get a meeting: `GET /api/meetings/:id`
   - End a meeting: `DELETE /api/meetings/:id`
   - Generate join URL: `POST /api/meetings/:id/join`

## Expected Results

### Configuration Service

- Default configuration is loaded successfully
- Server-specific configuration overrides are applied
- Configuration is cached and reloaded when TTL expires

### User Authentication Service

- Discord users are mapped to Kaltura users with appropriate roles
- JWT tokens are generated and verified correctly
- Role-based access control is enforced

### Kaltura Client

- Sessions are created with appropriate privileges
- Meetings are created, retrieved, and managed correctly
- Join URLs are generated with appropriate permissions

### API Gateway

- Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens
- Meeting endpoints return expected responses
- Error handling returns appropriate error messages

### Discord Bot

- Commands are registered and handled correctly
- Interactions (buttons, slash commands) work as expected
- Responses include appropriate embeds and components

## Testing with Mock Responses

When testing with mock responses (development mode), the following behavior is expected:

- Kaltura API calls return mock data
- Meeting IDs are randomly generated
- Join URLs point to a mock Kaltura domain
- Discord bot does not connect to Discord API

This mode is suitable for development and initial testing without requiring actual API credentials.

## Testing with Actual APIs

When testing with actual APIs (production mode), the following behavior is expected:

- Kaltura API calls return actual data
- Meeting IDs are assigned by Kaltura
- Join URLs point to the actual Kaltura domain
- Discord bot connects to Discord API and responds to commands

This mode requires valid API credentials and is suitable for final testing and production.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Discord Bot Not Responding

- Check if the bot is online in Discord
- Verify that the bot token is correct in the `.env` file
- Check the logs for any errors

### Kaltura API Errors

- Verify that the Kaltura Partner ID and Admin Secret are correct
- Check if the Kaltura API endpoint is accessible
- Look for specific error messages in the logs

### Configuration Issues

- Ensure that the `config/default_config.json` file exists and is valid JSON
- Check if the `config/overrides` directory exists and is writable
- Verify that server-specific configurations are correctly formatted

## Conclusion

The Kaltura-Discord integration project has a comprehensive testing framework that covers all components of the integration. By following the testing process outlined in this document, you can ensure that the project works as expected and is ready for production use.

The use of mock responses allows for development and testing without requiring actual API credentials, making it easier to contribute to the project. When ready for production, the project can be tested with actual APIs to ensure everything works correctly in a real-world environment.
