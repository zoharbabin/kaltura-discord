# Kaltura-Discord Integration Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Kaltura-Discord integration is designed as a collection of loosely coupled services, each with a specific responsibility. This document provides an overview of the architecture, explaining how the components work together to provide a seamless integration between Kaltura and Discord.

## High-Level Architecture

The integration follows a microservices architecture with the following main components:

1. **Discord Bot Service**: Handles Discord interactions and commands
2. **API Gateway**: Routes requests and manages authentication
3. **Kaltura Integration Service**: Interfaces with Kaltura APIs
4. **User Authentication Service**: Manages identity mapping and token generation
5. **Configuration Service**: Manages server-specific configurations

## Component Details

### Discord Bot Service

The Discord Bot Service is responsible for handling Discord interactions and commands. It uses the Discord.js library to interact with the Discord API.

**Key Files:**
- `src/discord/bot.ts`: Main Discord bot implementation
- `src/discord/commands.ts`: Command registration and definitions
- `src/discord/commandHandlers.ts`: Command handler implementations
- `src/discord/interactions.ts`: Interaction handling (buttons, etc.)

**Responsibilities:**
- Register slash commands with Discord
- Handle command interactions
- Handle button interactions
- Respond to users with appropriate messages and embeds

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client-side requests. It provides RESTful API endpoints for integration with other services.

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/apiGateway.ts`: Main API Gateway implementation

**Responsibilities:**
- Route requests to appropriate handlers
- Authenticate requests using JWT tokens
- Provide endpoints for meetings and authentication
- Handle CORS and error handling

### Kaltura Integration Service

The Kaltura Integration Service interfaces with Kaltura's APIs to manage meetings and sessions.

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/kalturaClient.ts`: Kaltura API client implementation

**Responsibilities:**
- Create and manage Kaltura sessions
- Create, retrieve, and manage meetings
- Generate join URLs for meetings
- Provide mock responses for development without Kaltura API access

### User Authentication Service

The User Authentication Service manages user identity mapping between Discord and Kaltura, as well as token generation and verification.

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/userAuthService.ts`: User authentication and mapping implementation

**Responsibilities:**
- Map Discord users to Kaltura users
- Generate and verify JWT tokens
- Generate Kaltura sessions for users
- Implement role-based access control

### Configuration Service

The Configuration Service manages server-specific configurations, allowing each Discord server to have its own settings.

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/configService.ts`: Configuration service implementation
- `config/default_config.json`: Default configuration
- `config/overrides/`: Server-specific configuration overrides

**Responsibilities:**
- Load default configuration
- Apply server-specific configuration overrides
- Cache configurations with TTL
- Provide configuration management functions

## Data Flow

### Command Flow

1. User issues command in Discord
2. Discord Bot validates permissions
3. Request routed through API Gateway
4. Kaltura Integration Service creates session
5. User Auth Service generates tokens
6. Response returns to Discord Bot
7. Bot presents join options to user

### Notification Flow

1. Kaltura meeting event occurs
2. Webhook received by Notification Service
3. Configuration Service provides server preferences
4. Event processed and formatted using templates
5. Discord message sent to configured channel
6. Audit log entry created

### Configuration Flow

1. Default configuration loaded at startup
2. Server-specific overrides applied when available
3. Configuration cached with TTL
4. Services request configuration from Configuration Service
5. Configuration reloaded when TTL expires

## Security

### Token-Based Authentication

The integration uses JWT tokens for authentication between services. These tokens include user identity and role information, and are short-lived to minimize security risks.

### Role-Based Access Control

Discord roles are mapped to Kaltura roles, allowing for fine-grained access control. The mapping is configurable per Discord server.

### Secure Communication

All service-to-service communication is done over HTTPS, and API keys and tokens are transmitted securely.

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling

The services are designed to be stateless, allowing for easy horizontal scaling. Each service can be scaled independently based on load.

### Caching Strategy

The integration uses caching for frequently accessed data, such as server configurations and Kaltura session metadata.

## Development and Deployment

### Development Environment

The integration can be run in development mode, which uses mock responses for Kaltura API calls and doesn't connect to the Discord API. This allows for development and testing without requiring actual API credentials.

### Production Environment

In production mode, the integration connects to the actual Kaltura and Discord APIs, requiring valid API credentials.

### Containerization

The integration can be containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment to various environments.

## Conclusion

The Kaltura-Discord integration follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns. Each component has a specific responsibility, making the system modular, scalable, and maintainable.

The use of TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest ensures code quality and testability, while the configuration system allows for flexible deployment across multiple Discord servers.
